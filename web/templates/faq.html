            GNU Project is the given name to the Free Software movement that initiated at 1983 by Richard M. Stallman.
            It is unknown why name of an animal (GNU) is chosen as project name. However, the project's symbol is animal's
            itself and the project is associated with this symbol all around the world. 'Is GNU an acronym?' question is
            answered by Stallman as 'GNU is Not Unix' during an interview.

            ITU Software Freedom Club (ITUGnu), as name suggests, is a student club which continues
            activities under the roof of Istanbul Technical University. Its mission is spreading Free
            Software Philosophy, encourage and make people understand Free Software usage throughout Turkey,
            starting from ITU. In this context, we arrange lectures and seminars about programming languages
            and free technologies during semester.

            No, you don't have to. Even though ITU students and personal have higher priority, every member
            of our club can participate activities and lectures. Also it is not required to be a member of ITU
            to be a member of our club. You can reach registration page via Facebook link at the bottom of page.
            To be an official member, you can register with registration form at our website so that, we can add

            No, they are not. None of our members and instructors gain money from our activities and lectures.
            Our members and administrative body, who adopted Freedom of Information as motto, provide these lectures
            and services. However, if our members want to support us, we suggest them to make donations to charities
            such as TEMA and animal shelters so that, all of us can be useful to society and humanity.

            It is forbidden to use computers with proprietary operating systems. Any computer with
            W*ndows will not be accepted and supported. Status of macOS is undecided among free software communities
            since it is a UNIX-like operating system and uses free software behind the scenes. Therefore, you can use
            a computer with macOS currently. However, we cannot provide a healthy support for macOS. Therefore, it will
            be better for you to use a GNU/Linux distribution even it is installed in a virtual environment.

            Yes. Our lectures are done in classrooms and lecture halls, not in computer laboratories. Therefore, you
            must bring your own computers. If you don't own a laptop or cannot bring it for another problem, please

            Yes. There is a strict attendance obligation for our lectures. If you do not attend lectures without reason,
            you will be blacklisted and you will not be accepted to any ongoing lectures. Also, we will contact other

            No, they are not. Password and cypher are unreleated two terms. Password is password, cypher is cypher.
            Do not drive people nuts! Even if cypher is used for password everywhere, it does not give you right to
