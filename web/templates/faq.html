            "GNU Project is the given name to the Free Software movement that initiated at 1983 by Richard M. Stallman.
            It is unknown why name of an animal (GNU) is chosen as project name. However, the project's symbol is animal's
            itself and the project is associated with this symbol all around the world. 'Is GNU an acronym?' question is
            answered by Stallman as 'GNU is Not Unix' during an interview."
